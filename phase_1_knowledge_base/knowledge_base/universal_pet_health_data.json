Many of the foods, such asfruits and vegetables, that people digest just fine can wreak havoc on a dog\u2019s body, causing severe health problems. On the other hand, some of the foods people eat can be introduced to a dog\u2019s diet just fine, and even provide health benefits such as joint strength, better breath, and allergy immunity."
